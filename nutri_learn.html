                    <h3>APRICOT</h3>
                    <div class="content">
                        <h4>1. Good Source of Vitamin A</h4>
                        <p>
                            Apricots are packed with Vitamin A, which is also known as retinol. It's fat soluble, and helps in the enhancement of vision, among other things. And it keeps the immune system in check, protecting your skin in the process. Retinol and Beta Carotene (also present in apricots) also reduces the chances of you developing a serious eye-related disorder called Neovascular ARMD – an age-related macular degeneration that causes loss of vision over the years.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>2.Rich in Fiber</h4>
                        <p>
                            Whether you eat it dried, or fresh, apricots are a good source of dietary fiber. Given that the retinol in apricot is fat soluble, the fruit dissolves in the body easily, and the important nutrients are easily absorbed by the system. And it breaks down fatty acids fast, which means your digestion is in order. And not only that, the fruit protects you from gastrointestinal concerns by cleaning out the intestines regularly.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>3. Good for Your Heart</h4>
                        <p>
                            Given that the fruit is high on fiber content, it helps to reduce the bad cholesterol content in the body, and that means your heart is protected. And at the same time, it increases the good cholesterol. Plus the potassium content in the fruit balances the electrolyte levels in our system, keeping our heart muscles in order. All you have to do is eat one or two fresh apricots every day, or a handful of dried ones.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>4. Treasure Chest of Antioxidants</h4>
                        <p>
                            Ripe apricots are natural sources of antioxidants. When consumed daily, it helps the body to get rid of toxins that we tend to collect over time. Antioxidants in turn also kill free radicals that damage our cells.

                        <br> 
                        <h4>5. Good for Your Blood</h4>
                        <p>
                            Any plant produce that contains iron has non-heme iron, and that includes apricot. This type of iron takes its time to be absorbed by the body, and the longer it stays in the system, the better your chances in preventing anemia. It's recommended that you take some vitamin C along with it to ensure better absorption of the non-heme iron.

        <div class="content">
            <p>It may surprise you to know that it is not actually an artichoke. Even the first part of its name is deceptive as it is native to North America and is not associated with Jerusalem. This first part of the name is believed to have been a corruption of the term ‘Girasole’ which is ‘sunflower’ in Italian. This is because the Jerusalem artichoke flower looks just like regular yellow sunflowers. Jerusalem artichoke leaves appear furred and rough.
                Jerusalem artichoke roots are a source of pre-biotics such as Fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Essentially, these are what certain friendly bacteria use as nutrients. These bacteria play a vital role in the development as well as the functioning of a healthy immune system. It is one of the best food sources available of the fiber inulin, which helps colon function.The Jerusalem artichoke is a type of fermentable carbohydrate and a good source of dietary fiber. A lot of these foods, taken in moderation, are great for helping healthy bacteria to flourish and are beneficial for our intestinal lining. Despite its calories, the Jerusalem artichoke's vitamins and nutrients, such as thiamin, potassium and iron; make it a popular health food.

            <h3>ASPARAGUS</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <h4>1. Many nutrients, Low calories</h4>
                <p>Asparagus is low in calories but boasts an impressive nutrient profile. It also possesses small amounts of other micronutrients, including iron, zinc and riboflavin.
                    It’s an excellent source of vitamin K, an essential nutrient involved in blood clotting and bone health .
                    In addition, asparagus is high in folate, a nutrient that is vital for a healthy pregnancy and many important processes in the body, including cell growth and DNA formation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>2. Good Source of Antioxidants</h4>
                <p>
                   
Antioxidants are compounds that help protect your cells from the harmful effects of free radicals and oxidative stress.
Oxidative stress contributes to aging, chronic inflammation and many diseases, including cancer.
Asparagus, like other green vegetables, is high in antioxidants. These include vitamin E, vitamin C and glutathione, as well as various flavonoids and polyphenols.
Asparagus is particularly high in the flavonoids quercetin, isorhamnetin and kaempferol.
These substances have been found to have blood pressure-lowering, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anticancer effects in a number of human, test-tube and animal studies.
What’s more, purple asparagus contains powerful pigments called anthocyanins, which give the vegetable its vibrant color and have antioxidant effects in the body.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>3. Can Improve Digestive Health</h4>
                <p>
                    Asparagus is particularly high in insoluble fiber, which adds bulk to stool and supports regular bowel movements.
                    It also contains a small amount of soluble fiber, which dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance in the digestive tract.
                    Soluble fiber feeds the friendly bacteria in the gut, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus.
                    Increasing the number of these beneficial bacteria plays a role in strengthening the immune system and producing essential nutrients like vitamins B12 and K2.Eating asparagus as part of a fiber-rich diet is an excellent way to help meet your fiber needs and keep your digestive system healthy.

The monounsaturated fatty acids in avocados also support the absorption of other beneficial fat-soluble antioxidants, such as beta carotene. As a result, adding avocados to the diet may help reduce the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>4. Helps Support a Healthy Pregnancy</h4>
                <p>
                    Asparagus is an excellent source of folate, also known as vitamin B9.
                    Just half a cup of asparagus provides adults with 34% of their daily folate needs and pregnant women with 22% of their daily needs.
                    Folate is an essential nutrient that helps form red blood cells and produce DNA for healthy growth and development. It’s especially important during the early stages of pregnancy to ensure the healthy development of the baby.
                    Getting enough folate from sources like asparagus, green leafy vegetables and fruit can protect against neural tube defects, including spina bifida.
                </p>

            <div class="content">
                <h4>1. Rich in nutrients</h4>
                <p>Avocados are a source of vitamins C, E, K, and B6, as well as riboflavin, niacin, folate, pantothenic acid, magnesium, and potassium. They also provide lutein, beta carotene, and omega-3 fatty acids.

                    Avocados contain high levels of healthy, beneficial fats, which can help a person feel fuller between meals. Eating fat slows the breakdown of carbohydrates, which helps keep blood sugar levels stable.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>2. Healthy for the heart</h4>
                <p>
                    In every 100 g of avocado there are 76 milligrams of a natural plant sterol called beta sitosterol. Regularly consuming beta sitosterol and other plant sterols may help maintain healthy cholesterol levels, which are important for heart health.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>3. Great for vision</h4>
                <p>
                    
Avocados contain lutein and zeaxanthin, two phytochemicals present in eye tissue. They provide antioxidant protection to help minimize damage, including from UV light.

The monounsaturated fatty acids in avocados also support the absorption of other beneficial fat-soluble antioxidants, such as beta carotene. As a result, adding avocados to the diet may help reduce the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>4. May help prevent osteoporosis</h4>
                <p>
                   
Half an avocado provides approximately 18% of the daily value of vitamin K.
This nutrient is often overlooked but is essential for bone health. Taking in enough vitamin K can support bone health by increasing calcium absorption and reducing the urinary excretion of calcium.
                </p>
                <br> 
                <h4>5. Natural detoxification</h4>
                <p>
                    Adequate fiber promotes regular bowel movements, which are crucial for the excretion of toxins through the bile and stool.
                    Studies have shown that dietary fiber also promotes good gut health and microbial diversity. This helps the body maintain a healthy bacterial balance. This can reduce inflammation and aggravation of the digestive tract.

        <div class="content">
            <h4>1. Bananas are one of the best fruit sources of vitamin B6</h4>
            <p>
Vitamin B6 from bananas is easily absorbed by your body and a medium-sized banana can provide about a quarter of your daily vitamin B6 needs.Vitamin B6 is also good for pregnant women as it helps meet their baby’s development needs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>2. Bananas are respectable sources of vitamin C</h4>
            <p>
                You may not associate bananas with vitamin C but a medium-sized banana will provide about 10% of your daily vitamin C needs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>3. Manganese in bananas is good for your skin</h4>
            <p>
                One medium-sized banana provides approximately 13% of your daily manganese needs. Manganese helps your body make collagen and protects your skin and other cells against free radical damage.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>4. Potassium in bananas is good for your heart health and blood pressure</h4>
            <p>
A medium-sized banana will provide around 320-400 mg of potassium, which meets about 10% of your daily potassium needs.
Potassium helps your body maintain a healthy heart and blood pressure. In addition, bananas are low in sodium. The low sodium and high potassium combination helps to control high blood pressure.
            </p>
            <br> 
            <h4>5. Bananas can aid digestion and help beat gastrointestinal issues</h4>
            <p>
A medium banana will provide about 10-12% of your daily fibre needs. Singapore’s Health Promotion Board recommends a daily dietary fibre intake of 20g for women and 26g for men.
Soluble and insoluble fibres play an important role in your health. Soluble fibre helps your body control your blood sugar level and get rid of fatty substances such as cholesterol. Insoluble fibre adds weight and softness to stools, making it easier for you to have regular bowel movements. This helps to keep your gut healthy and safe from harmful bacteria.
Bananas, especially newly-ripened ones, contain starch that does not digest (resistant starch) in your small intestine and is able to pass into the large intestine. Such bananas help you manage your weight better as you stay full for longer.

            <p>
                Protein is a vital nutrient that plays a key role in maintaining and repairing the body. Beans are high in amino acids, the building blocks of protein.
                There are 20 amino acidsTrusted Source, and nine of these are essential. There are also two types of protein sources: complete and incomplete.
                Animal products, soy, and quinoa are all complete proteins, which means they contain all nine essential amino acids.
                However, of all the types of beans, only soybeans contain all nine amino acids.
                People can combine incomplete proteins with nuts, seeds, dairy products, or grains at a single meal or throughout the day to make complete proteins.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>2. Folate</h4>
            <p>
Beans contain several vital nutrients, including folate. Folate is essential for overall health, to make healthy red blood cells, and help prevent neural tube defects in a fetus during pregnancy.
A 1-cup, or 155gTrusted Source, serving of shelled edamame beans provides 482 micrograms (mcg) of folate.

        <div class="content">
            <h4>1. Cancer prevention</h4>
            <p>
Broccoli shares cancer fighting and immune boosting properties with other cruciferous vegetables such as cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and cabbage. Broccoli contains properties that depletes estrogens which usually cause cancer in the body. Research shows that broccoli is extremely suitable for preventing breast and uterus cancer.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>2. Cholesterol reduction</h4>
            <p>
                Like many whole foods, broccoli is packed with soluble fib>er that draws cholesterol out of your body. This is because the fiber in broccoli helps bind with bile acids in the digestive tract. This makes excreting cholesterol out of our body easy. According to a research by the Institute of Food Research, a particular variety of broccoli can help reduce the blood LDL-cholesterol levels by 6 per cent.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>3. Reducing allergic reaction and inflammation</h4>
            <p>
                Research has shown the ability of kaempferol to lessen the impact of allergy-related substances on our body. Broccoli even has significant amounts of omega 3 fatty acids, which are well known as anti-inflammatory. Along with this, broccoli can also help people suffering from arthritis as broccoli contains sulforaphane, a chemical that blocks the enzymes that can cause joint destruction and hence lead to inflammation.

            <h4>1. Protection from radiation therapy</h4>
            <p>
                A compound found in cabbage and other cruciferous vegetables known as 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM) has been shown to increase short-term survival rates in some animal studies on radiation
                In a study conducted at Georgetown University, rats were given a lethal dose of radiation. Some were left untreated, and others were treated with a daily injection of DIM for 2 weeks.
                All the untreated rats died, but over 50 percent of those receiving DIM remained alive at the 30-day mark.
                The same researchers ran the experiment on mice and found similar results.
                They were able to determine that the DIM-treated mice had higher counts of red and white blood cells and blood platelets, which radiation therapy often diminishes.
                It is thought that DIM has protective effects against cancer, but this study shows there is also hope for using it as a shield to protect healthy tissues during cancer treatment in the future.

            <h4>2. Immunity and digestion</h4>
            <p>
                A popular way to consume cabbage is in a fermented form such as sauerkraut and kimchi. Chocked full of probiotics, fermented foods might be one of the best things you can consume for your immune and digestive systems. Healthy microbes generate an acidic environment to preserve and develop flavor; the enzymes produced in fermentation make vitamins and minerals easier to absorb.
                The fiber and water content in cabbage also help to prevent constipation and maintain a healthy digestive tract. Eating adequate fiber promotes regularity, which is crucial for the excretion of toxins through the bile and stool.
                Recent studies have shown that dietary fiber may even play a role in regulating the immune system and inflammation, consequently decreasing the risk of inflammation-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity.
                Cabbage contains the antioxidants choline, beta-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin as well as the flavonoids kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin.
                Red cabbage tends to contain more of these compounds than green cabbage.

The same potent anthocyanins in red cabbage that help protect against cancer have been shown to suppress the inflammation that may lead to cardiovascular disease.
A recent report in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition associated the intake of flavonoid-rich foods with a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and stated that even small amounts of flavonoid-rich foods might be beneficial. The high polyphenol content in cabbage might also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by preventing platelet buildup and reducing blood pressure.

            <p>
Dates have an excellent nutrition profile.
Since they’re dried, their calorie content is higher than most fresh fruit. The calorie content of dates is similar to that of other dried fruits, such as raisins and figs.
Most of the calories in dates come from carbs. The rest are from a very small amount of protein. Despite their calories, dates contain some important vitamins and minerals in addition to a significant amount of fiber.
                </p>

            <h4>2. High in Fiber</h4>
            <p>                
Getting enough fiber is important for your overall health.
With almost 7 grams of fiber in a 3.5-ounce serving, including dates in your diet is a great way to increase your fiber intake.
Fiber can benefit your digestive health by preventing constipation. It promotes regular bowel movements by contributing to the formation of stool.
In one study, 21 people who consumed 7 dates per day for 21 days experienced improvements in stool frequency and had a significant increase in bowel movements compared to when they did not eat dates.
Furthermore, the fiber in dates may be beneficial for blood sugar control. Fiber slows digestion and may help prevent blood sugar levels from spiking too high after eating.For this reason, dates have a low glycemic index (GI), which measures how quickly your blood sugar rises after eating a certain food.

            <p>Beans are high in dietary fiber, a plant compound that resists digestion as it moves through your digestive tract.
                They’re particularly rich in soluble fiber, a type of fiber that absorbs water in the digestive tract to form a thick, gel-like texture .
                Soluble fiber is associated with a long list of health benefits, including improved digestive regularity and blood sugar management, lowered LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, and enhanced heart health.
                However, increasing your fiber intake too quickly can also cause negative side effects, including gas and bloating.
                Once dietary fiber reaches the colon, it’s fermented by the beneficial bacteria that live there. Gas is a byproduct of that fermentation.
