                        <p>There are many different martial arts styles to choose from once you decide to start training. Many people start out wanting to learn karate and begin looking at the different styles from there. If you are new to martial arts it can be difficult to decide which style is right for you. Different styles can include, Taekwondo, Karate, Jiu-Jitsu, Aikido, Kung-Fu and many more. Each style of martial arts tends to focus on specific techniques like punches, kicks, grappling, elbows, knees, grabs, and locks to name a few.
                            <br><br>
                            A common question asked by beginners is "Which is the best style to practice", and there is no right or wrong answer. It really depends on what you are interested in and what form appeals to you the most. Each art has a "specialty", for instance, Taekwondo focuses on kicks, Jiu-Jitsu focuses on grappling, boxing works the hands, and the list could go on forever. I don't believe any art is the best, however; to be a strong martial artist it is important to be well rounded. It is quite common for people to start in one style and then decide to learn other styles as well.

                            1. Flexibility
                            <br>Martial arts require a certain dose of flexibility. Some will need more and some less, but your flexibility will surely improve no matter what martial art you choose. It’s important to work on flexibility as you dive into more challenging techniques, such as high kicks, spinning strikes, or ground submissions. Not only will it help you win fights, but it will dramatically reduce the risk of injury in training, sparring, or competing.
                            <br><br>
                            2. Weight Loss & Muscle Gain
                            <br>Training any martial art will give you a complete body transformation if you’re persistent.Most martial arts are high-intensity workouts, meaning you burn a lot of calories quickly. Burning calories means rapid weight loss and loss of excess fatty tissue.
                            <br><br>
                            3. Balance
                            <br> Consciously or not, training any martial art will improve your balance and body control. As you train, you learn how to use your body in a whole different way, improving your overall balance, coordination, and stability.
                            <br><br>
                            4. Cardiovascular Health
                            <br>Every form of high-intensity (HIIT) workout improves cardiovascular health. As the effort level increases in HIIT workouts, the more oxygen your muscles need to perform. That’s why your blood vessels expand, and circulation improves, leading to much better cardiovascular health.
                            <br><br>
                            5. Agility & Reflexes
                            <br>Training helps you develop fast-twitch fiber in your muscles, responsible for explosiveness and quick outbursts of energy, such as strikes, evasions, lateral movement, etc. The reflexes evolve as you get used to remaining focused in stressful situations, such as hand-to-hand combat, sparring, etc.
