          <div class="accordion_content">
            <p>
              When you choose a weight for strength training, pick a weight that’s “heavy for you.” For example, 5 lbs
              may be heavy for one person, while 50 lbs is heavy for someone else. You should be able to complete all
              reps in a set with good form, and have to push yourself to finish the last 1-2 reps of each set. If you
              could easily breeze through 15-20 reps of an exercise at your current weight, it’s a good sign to bump it
              up a little. On the other hand, if you’re struggling to complete all reps and compromising form, decrease
              the amount of weight or resistance you’re using.

          <div class="accordion_content">
            <p>
              No. You can derive benefit from yoga without a special vegetarian diet. However, for the most complete
              yoga experience, a vegetarian diet is preferred. Vegetarian yogic foods are felt to calm the mind and
              sharpen the intellect. These foods supply the utmost energy and are digested easily.

          <label for="section3" class="accordion_label">How often should I rest?</label>
          <div class="accordion_content">
            <p>
              Rest is neccessary as this is when the body is able to restore its levels, rebuild muscle, and gather
              energy and fuel for the next session. If you’re constantly working yourself into the ground, there’s a
              point where you’ll hit diminishing returns. Too much exercise can lead to overtraining, which can
              potentially cause elevated resting heart rate, injury, poor sleep, low energy levels, depression/anxiety,
              agitation, decrease in performance, and extreme soreness/pain.
              The amount of rest you need depends on your current routine, how quickly you recover, your fueling
              strategies, and the intensity of your workouts. If you’re working out at intense levels a few times each
              week, you may need more rest time to recover in between sessions. If your workouts are lower-intensity,
              you could possibly work out every day without the effects of overtraining. Make sure you have at least 1-2
              days of full rest each week to allow the body to repair and prevent overtraining.

          <div class="accordion_content">
            <p>
              Yes, yoga can help you lose weight. The gentle postures coupled with mindful breathing help to detoxify
              the body, cleanse the digestive tract, and decrease anxiety and stress. Stress is one of the biggest
              culprits behind weight gain. Yoga can help reduce your stress as well as provide a gentle form of exercise
              that can strengthen the body and tone your muscles.

            <p>
              Not at all. It is an exercise for all ages (6-70) with any and every ability level possible. The neat
              thing about Zumba is you only work as hard as you want to. Two people in the same class could do the same
              steps and one may not even break a sweat, while the other is drenched.

          <div class="accordion_content">
            <p>
              Contrary to common belief, sore muscles do not mean that you had a *good workout* and you shouldn’t aim to
              be seriously sore after each session. I find that when clients are super sore, it hinders their activity
              level for the rest of the day and days following the workout. For this reason, we take it easy on the
              first session because no matter what we do, it’s different and new, which means they’ll be a tiny bit
              sore. What’s the benefit of pushing yourself super hard so you can’t move the rest of the week? If your
              muscles are incredbily sore, focus on adequate water and protein intake, stretch your muscles (dynamic and
              static stretching feels great), a bath with epsom salts, and magnesium oil. Easy cardio and moving the
              legs can help to reduce soreness. Also, if you have a sauna blanket or access to a sauna, this is an
              incredible recovery tool for sore muscles and inflammation.

          <div class="accordion_content">
            <p>
              Pilates is more dynamic than yoga but less aggressive, sweaty and high-impact than aerobics, jogging or
              gym-work, which, unlike Pilates, can all place damaging strain on the joints and/or heart.
              Whereas most forms of exercise build the body’s stronger muscles, Pilates exercises work as much or more
              to strengthen the weaker ones too. The result is a properly balanced body, with better joint mobility, a
              firm musculature and good, natural posture.

              Yes it is possible to learn boxing at home. It will involve watching a lot of videos. But the only
              downside of training boxing at home you're not to have a boxing partner or someone to Spar with. We
              suggest using a punching bag for the strength training here. And if you become more available, we can

            <p>
              This depends on intensity and your goals. If your goal is general movement, your ideal amount of workout
              days will be different than someone who is training for a grueling athletic event. You could train 2-7
              times per week, depending on intensity. Make sure to vary intensity in your workout plan each week so you
              have a mix of challenging, easy, and moderate intensity levels. Always include 1-2 days of full rest.

            <p>
              You should exercise at a time that suits you and your body. There’s no evidence to suggest that an early
              morning workout is better for you, but some people are just more efficient at this time. You’ll get
              results regardless of the time of day, as long as it works for you.
