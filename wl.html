                        <p> You will hear it referred to as weightlifting, pumping iron, resistance training, strength training, or bodybuilding.
                            <br><br>
                            Whichever term you prefer, resistance training, most commonly done by lifting weights, as an exercise has long been a great way to get in shape and stay in shape. Weight lifting or weight training has many health benefits for both men and women. There are weight lifting and weight-training routines appropriate for men, woman, even children of any age, any size, and any body type.
                            <br><br>
                            If you want to increase muscle size, build muscle mass and strength, increase stamina, improve cardiac function, stave off the symptoms of osteoporosis, or improve your body mass index - you can accomplish all of that and so much more by adding a good weight training routine to your regular workout.
                            <br><br>

                    <h3>Benefits of Weightlifting</h3>
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/w_about2.jpg" class="flor"/>
                           <p>
                            1. Increases Bone Strength and Health
                            <br>
                            Your bones need to stay challenged, just like your brain needs exercise to stay sharp. After about age 30, you start to lose bone density at a small percentage each year. Keep in mind, women make up 80 per cent of osteoporosis cases as they lose bone mass.
                            <br><br>
                            2. Staves off Disease
                            <br>Phillips says the research community is recognizing that cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and “all the classic chronic diseases” including cancer aren’t as likely with any form of activity, from strength training to cardio.They say running is good for your heart, your brain, your waistline and your mental health. That applies to weight training too.
                            <br><br>
                            3. Boosts metabolism and fat loss
                            <br>You can change your metabolism because you’re burning more calories if you have more muscle. It’s an active tissue, it burns more energy at rest compared to fat.
                            <br><br>
                            4. Regulates insulin and lowers inflammation
                            <br>
                            Along with keeping away chronic disease, strength training has you burning through glucose, which is good news for those grappling with Type 2 diabetes who consistently need to manage blood sugar levels.Lifting weights even aids in fighting off inflammation, a marker tied to many diseases.
                            <br><br>
                            5. Improves posture, sleep, mood and energy levels
                            <br>
                            Besides the aesthetic, physiological and strength benefits, it affects just how we feel and how clearly we think. Weight training [has] proven to improve the quality of a person’s sleep.
                            <br><br>
                            6. Improves strength and endurance and balance
                            <br>
                            If your legs get stronger, then the amount of time you can spend on a walking challenge, on a treadmill, on a hike, will be longer. Even very good runners who do weight training actually improve their running efficiency. Strength training, even in the elderly, provides better balance and strengthens your legs.
