                        <p>Zumba is a fitness program that involves cardio and Latin-inspired dance. It was founded by Colombian dancer and choreographer Beto Pérez in 2001, and by 2012, it called itself the largest international branded fitness program in the world.
                            <br><br>
                            Zumba choreography is composed using all or some of sixteen core steps. There are four basic rhythms: salsa, reggaeton, merengue, and cumbia; each basic rhythm has four core steps.
                            <br><br>
                        Zumba is intended as a total-body cardio and aerobic workout, which provides a large calorie consumption. One 2012 study found that a participant burns 300 to 900 kcal with an hour-long Zumba exercise.
                        <br><br>
                        Because Zumba offers different options, proponents of the Zumba program claim that it is safe for all ages, meaning anyone can participate. Some of the classes are specifically aimed at elderly people.
                        <br><br>
                        Besides its high calorie burning benefit, Zumba can help lower the risk of heart disease, reduce blood pressure and bad cholesterol, and increase good cholesterol.<br>
