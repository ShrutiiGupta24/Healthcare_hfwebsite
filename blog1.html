 		<h2>Osteoporosis</h2>
 		<h5>I have fully recovered from Osteoporosis / Mar 19, 2022</h5>
 		<img src="images/blog image 1.jpg" alt="blog "/>
         
 		<p>I had been suffering from osteoporosis for the last 2 years. I went for medical treatment but couldn't find the adequate results....Of course it gave releifs from the my pain but was not the permanent solution for it.
            So one day i was scrolling all websites in search for the best natural treatment for my disease. And i came here started my daily exercises and diet according to their courses and now it's been a year and i am perfectly alright. I would like to thank "Health&Fitness" for this.</p>

        <p>I finally added oranges to my diet. I was previously told to do so but i just never liked the taste. But after finding out that citrus fruits are good of people with osteoporosis, i decided that my health comes first and i should add it.</p>

        <p>At first, I thought that i should have joined a session that is more dynamic and engaging, but today I have learnt that the dynamic and calm nature of Yoga is linked to spirituality</p>
