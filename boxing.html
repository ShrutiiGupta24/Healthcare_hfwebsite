Names like Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and George Foreman are synonymous with the sport of boxing. The ''Thrilla in Manilla,'' a fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in 1975, is considered one of the most popular sporting events in history. This sport is still quite popular around the world and in the U.S., with some boxing matches being watched by millions and millions of people.
                            <br>
                            Boxing has also become a popular fitness trend for people who are trying to lose weight or get in better shape. 
                            <br>
                            Boxing is a sport that has been around for thousands of years, becoming an official Olympic event in 688 B.C. There is even evidence of boxing occurring in ancient Egypt. Modern day sports boxing involves two athletes punching each other with padded gloves, trying to knock their opponent down and out. These fights usually last 3-12 rounds, with each round usually lasting three minutes.
                            <br>
                            High intensity types of exercises in boxing makes it a great form of aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise is any type of exercise that involves large groups of muscle, stresses the cardiovascular system, and increases a person's rate of breathing.

                            1. Improves heart health
                            <br>Boxers must have the ability to perform frequent bouts of high intensity activity during a training session or boxing match. The sport is a form of high intensity interval training (HIIT) and can push your body to repeatedly sustain intense bouts of activity
                            <br><br>
                            2. Aids weight loss
                            <br>

                            <br><br>

                            <br>
                            While most people may think punching power only comes from the shoulder, the act of throwing a punch involves the entire body.A good punch involves the lower limbs pushing against the ground and the coordination of the rest of the body to deliver power through the strike. Therefore, the lower limbs, as well as the core muscles, are a significant part of the punching movement
                            <br><br>
                            4. Improves balance
                            <br>
                            Boxing is a movement-intensive activity. It involves coordinated footwork, developing reactive movement strategies to changing conditions, and the muscular strength.Boxing has been used as a method to treat Parkinson’s disease.
                            <br><br>
                            5. Decreases stress
                            <br>There’s a truly cathartic effect that comes from letting out your stress in a healthy way, such as by punching a bag or focus mitt.
                            <br><br>
                            6. Lowers blood pressure
                            <br>Boxing and HIIT training, in general, have been shown to lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, helping decrease stress on the blood vessels.
